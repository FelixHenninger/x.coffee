__An implementation of [Knuth's Algorithm X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth's_Algorithm_X) in [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/).__

This package provides a basic implementation of Knuth's algorithm for finding solutions to an exact cover problem.

The implementation is based on [Ali Assaf's Python implementation](http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~aassaf9/python/algorithm_x.html), but translated, commented and extended slightly.
